# Storage Directory

This directory contains files that need to be stored by the application but should not be directly accessible via the web.

## Structure

- `/logs` - Application logs
- `/cache` - Cache files
- `/app` - Application-specific storage

## Logs

The logs directory contains application logs, typically organized by date. The application logs errors, warnings, and other information to help with debugging and monitoring.

Example log format:
```
[2023-05-15 14:23:45] [error] Database connection failed: Access denied for user 'user'@'localhost'
[2023-05-15 14:25:12] [info] User 123 logged in successfully
```

## Cache

The cache directory stores temporary files to improve application performance. This can include compiled templates, cached database queries, and other performance optimizations.

## App

The app directory is for application-specific storage needs. For example:

- Uploaded files that need processing before being moved to the public directory
- Temporary files generated by the application
- Configuration files that should not be in version control
- Generated reports or exports

## Security

The storage directory should not be accessible via the web. Your web server configuration should prevent direct access to this directory. If you're using Apache, the `.htaccess` file in the root directory should already include rules to deny access to this directory.

If you're using a different web server, make sure to configure it to deny access to the storage directory.

## Permissions

The storage directory must be writable by the web server process. On Unix-like systems, you may need to set the appropriate permissions:

```bash
chmod -R 775 storage
chown -R www-data:www-data storage
```

Or for Docker/Kubernetes environments:

```bash
chmod -R 777 storage
```

## Best Practices

1. Regularly rotate and clean up log files to prevent disk space issues
2. Implement log levels (error, warning, info, debug) to make logs more useful
3. Use structured logging when possible (JSON format) for easier parsing
4. Set up automated alerts for critical errors
5. Implement file size limits for uploads to prevent storage exhaustion
6. Consider using an external logging service for production environments
