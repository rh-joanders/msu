# Core Directory

This directory contains core application components that are essential for the framework to function.

## Components

- `Application.php` - The main application bootstrap class
- `Database.php` - Database connection and query builder (if needed)
- `Session.php` - Session management (if needed)
- `Cache.php` - Cache management (if needed)
- `Logger.php` - Logging functionality (if needed)
- `Security.php` - Security-related functions (if needed)

## Purpose

These core components provide the foundational functionality for the framework and are typically not modified directly. They are designed to be extended or configured rather than edited.

## Example: Creating a Custom Core Component

If you need to add a new core component, follow this pattern:

```php
<?php
namespace App\Core;

/**
 * Example Core Component
 */
class ExampleComponent
{
    /**
     * Singleton instance
     */
    private static $instance = null;
    
    /**
     * Private constructor to prevent direct instantiation
     */
    private function __construct()
    {
        // Initialization code
    }
    
    /**
     * Get the singleton instance
     *
     * @return ExampleComponent
     */
    public static function getInstance()
    {
        if (self::$instance === null) {
            self::$instance = new self();
        }
        
        return self::$instance;
    }
    
    /**
     * Example method
     *
     * @param string $param Example parameter
     * @return mixed
     */
    public function exampleMethod($param)
    {
        // Method implementation
        return $result;
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. Use the singleton pattern for components that should only have one instance
2. Keep core components focused on a single responsibility
3. Document your components thoroughly with PHPDoc comments
4. Use dependency injection to manage component dependencies
5. Make components configurable rather than hardcoding values
6. Follow consistent naming and coding standards
